;; ## Self-Describe CBOR

;; In many applications, it will be clear from the context that CBOR is being
;; employed for encoding a data item. For instance, a specific protocol might
;; specify the use of CBOR, or a media type is indicated that specifies its
;; use. However, there may be applications where such context information is
;; not available, such as when CBOR data is stored in a file and disambiguating
;; metadata is not in use. Here, it may help to have some distinguishing
;; characteristics for the data itself.
