;; ## Major Types

;; The header byte of each CBOR encoded data value uses the high-order three
;; bits to encode the _major type_ of the value. The remaining five bits
;; contain an additional information code, which often gives the size of the
;; resulting value.


;; ### Integers

;; Integers are represented by major types 0 and 1. Positive integers use type
;; 0, and the 5-bit additional information is either the integer itself (for
;; additional information values 0 through 23) or the length of additional
;; data.
;;
;; The encoding for negative integers follows the rules for unsigned integers,
;; except that the type is 1 and the value is negative one minus the encoded
;; unsigned integer.
;;
;; Additional information 24 means the value is represented in an additional
;; `uint8`, 25 means a `uint16`, 26 means a `uint32`, and 27 means a `uint64`.

;;
;; The format of this type is identical to that of byte strings (major type 2),
;; that is, as with major type 2, the length gives the number of bytes. This
;; type is provided for systems that need to interpret or display
;; human-readable text, and allows the differentiation between unstructured
;; bytes and text that has a specified repertoire and encoding.

;; break stop code. The chunks will be concatenated together into the final

;; ### Data Arrays

;; ### Data Maps

;; Maps of key-value entries are encoded using major type 5. A map is comprised

;; The map's length follows the rules for byte strings (major type 2), except
;; that the length denotes the number of pairs, not the length in bytes that
;; the map takes up.
;;
;; If the additional info indicates an indefinite length, the header must be
;; followed by a sequence of data value pairs, terminated with a break stop
;; code. An odd number of values before the break means the map is not
;; well-formed.

;; A map that has duplicate keys may be well-formed, but it is not valid, and
;; thus it causes indeterminate decoding.

;; ### Sets

;; Sets are represented as arrays of elements tagged with code 258.
;;
;; This support is implemented here rather than as a normal read/write handler
;; pair for two reasons. First, unlike the normal write-handlers which operate
;; on _concrete types_, there are many types which represent the 'set' semantic
;; in Clojure, and we don't want to maintain a brittle list of such types. That
;; approach would also prevent easy extension to new set types outside the core
;; libray. Instead, we use the `set?` predicate to trigger this handler.
;;
;; Second, when the codec is in canonical mode, we want to sort the entries in
;; the set before writing them out. A write handler wouldn't have a way to know
;; whether the codec had this behavior enabled, requiring coordination between
;; the codec setting and the selection of a canonical writer vs a regular one.

(defn- jump-decode
  "Use a jump-table to decode the next value from the input.

  For decoding efficiency, we can directly represent decoding operations based
  on the first full byte of an encoded value. This can short circuit
  conditional logic in many cases.

  See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049#appendix-B for details."
